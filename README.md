# MTG DNA
MTG Dumbly Named AI uses Forge to simulate games in order to build good Magic: The Gathering decks (standard-legal) in Best of One matches using a genetic algorithm.

# Forge
The simulator, rules engine and AI playing the games are contained in Forge (not mine).
MTG DNA uses release 1.6.21 (latest released set is RNA), which can be found [here](https://www.slightlymagic.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&t=23219).
